# CMPE-Twelve
Assignments from my Introduction to Assembly and Systems languages class (2017 Fall)

Using the MIPS Assembly language, I made the following labs:

  **Lab 3**: Takes an integer and returns it's representation in binary, (2's complement if negative).
  
  **Lab 4**: Generates the prime number decomposition using the sieve of Eratosthenes given an input of an unsigned integer greater then 2.
  
  **Lab 5**: Generates an "encrypted" text given an input string and key (Shifts the input string by the relative characters in the repeating key string).
